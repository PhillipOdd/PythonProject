# Apartment Management System

The Apartment Management System is a Python-based program designed to help manage apartment details, clients, and room availability. This system allows you to keep track of apartments, clients residing in them, and the status of available rooms.

## Features

 **Apartment Management**: Add, view, and update apartment details such as name, total rooms, and available rooms.

 **Client Management**: Add, view, and remove clients from apartments. The system automatically updates the available rooms accordingly.

 **Dynamic Apartment Creation**: When adding a client to a non-existent apartment, the system dynamically creates the apartment.

 **Database Integration**: The system uses an SQLite database to store apartment and client data, ensuring data persistence.
